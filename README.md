Frontend Mini Projects (HTML + CSS)

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly yet visually appealing Frontend Projects built using only HTML and CSS.
This repository represents my early journey into web development — focusing on layouts, styling, UI components, and building clean, responsive designs without using JavaScript.

These small projects helped me strengthen my fundamentals in CSS, flexbox, positioning, typography, responsive design, and UI/UX thinking.
